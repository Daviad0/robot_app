#### Mobile application for managaging attendance and meetings, team-wide communications, as well announcements and informatino for individual subgroups.

## Installing

### IOS
For IOS, you need to install TestFlight since it has not been deployed on the App Store. To gain access to the app, you need to contact David.

### Android
The app has not been deployed to the play store, so you need to [download the raw APK](https://lr.robosmrt.com/ql/android).

## How it works
